## 🔄 Backend Integration Ready

The application is designed for easy backend integration:

1. **Update API URL**: Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in environment variables
2. **Disable MSW**: Remove MSWProvider wrapper
3. **Match API Contract**: Backend should implement the same endpoints
4. **Update Auth**: Optionally switch to HTTP-only cookies

All API endpoints are documented in the code and README.
